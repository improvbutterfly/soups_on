# Soup's On!
Interactive website to discover the best soup recipes on food.com.

This is just a fun little project I decided to work on as part of a writing competition where the prompt was "Soup's On." I found a recipe dataset and reduced it to just soup recipes and the information I was interested in.

This repo is where you can find the code, but you should really check out the [interactive website](https://improvbutterfly.github.io/soups_on/)

Read about this project on [my blog](https://dominicacreates.com/2024/11/19/soups-on/).
